# End-to-End PDF, OCR, and TXT Data Extraction Automation (Python + VBA)

This project delivers a full-stack automation solution for extracting structured data from unstructured and semi-structured documents such as PDFs, scanned PDFs (OCR), and TXT files.
Built with Python and VBA, the tools are designed to replace manual data entry processes with fast, reliable, and scalable automation.

## What Problems It Solves:

- Manual extraction from large and messy documents is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.
- Scanned PDFs often lack machine-readable structure, making traditional parsing impossible without OCR.
- Organizations handling financial reports, invoices, legal documents, or bulk textual data waste resources on repetitive tasks.

## Key Highlights:

- High Flexibility: Handles both native and scanned PDFs, as well as TXT files, with customizable extraction rules (e.g., keyword-based parsing).
- Error Handling and Resilience: Built-in validation and fallback mechanisms reduce failure rates in messy or inconsistent input files.
- Smart Formatting: Outputs clean, analysis-ready Excel files with preserved structures like currency formats, numeric precision, and multi-page mappings.
- Batch Processing: Converts thousands of pages across multiple files in one-click operations.
- Scalability: Adaptable to various document types and volumes without major changes to the codebase.
- Integration Friendly: Designed to integrate into larger workflows (ERP, CRM, or reporting systems) if needed.
- User Friendly: Simple VBA user interfaces and Python scripts allow non-technical users to trigger complex extraction processes easily.
- Technologies used: Python, VBA, OCR (Tesseract), Error Handling, Batch Automation, Data Extraction, Smart Formatting.

These set of tools have been applied in real-world scenarios such as financial report extraction, invoice processing, legal document digitization, and bulk data automation.
