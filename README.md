# End-to-End-PDF-OCR-and-TXT-Data-Extraction-Automation

This project showcases a complete automation framework for extracting structured data from complex documents, including scanned PDFs and TXT files. Built with Python and VBA, the solution supports:

## Key Highlights:

- Automated PDF to Excel conversion with smart formatting and high accuracy
- OCR preprocessing for scanned documents (Python-based)
- Keyword-based data structuring and error handling
- Batch processing of multiple files with one click
- Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and Python user interfaces for ease of use

These tools have been applied in real-world scenarios such as financial report extraction, invoice processing, legal document digitization, and bulk data automation.
